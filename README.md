# Goal

The goal of this task is to write a function grade() that grades a student's 
answer and finds certain common mistakes. In particular, the program should 
figure out (1) if there is a typo in the student's answer, (2) if a word is 
missing or (3) if a word is wrong. If the program finds a common mistake it
should highlight it.

# Specification

Here is the specification in Python (you do not have to use python). Make
sure to make the function available from the command line.

def grade(correct_answer, student_answer):
""" 
    - correct_answer: a unicode string, the correct answer
    - student_answer: a unicode string, what the student typed  

    returns a tuple (correct, blame, highlights)
        - correct:      a boolean, True if and only if the student_answer 
                        should be considered a correct answer
        - blame:        one out of {None, "typo", "missing", "wrong_word"} 
                        depending on the cause of the mistake, if it can 
                        be detected
        - highlights:   a list of tuples, where each tuple is of type 
                        ((c1, c2), ((s1, s2)) and c1/s1 is the index of the 
                        first character of a blamed word in 
                        the correct/student's answer and c2/s2 is the index
                        of the last character of that same blamed word 

    Examples:

    >>> grade("house", "house")
    (True, None, [])

    >>> grade("house", "house.")
    (True, None, [])

    >>> grade("A house", "a house.")
    (True, None, [])

    >>> grade("house", "hhouse")
    (True, "typo", [((0,5), (0,6))])

    >>> grade("This is my house.", "This is mi hhouse")
    (True, "typo", [((8,10), (8,10)), ((11, 16),(11,17))])

    >>> grade("This is my house.", "This my house!")
    (False, "missing", [((5,7), (5,5))])

    >>> grade("This is my house.", "This is your house!")
    (False, "wrong_word", [((8,10), (8,12))])

"""

## Punctuation

Punctuation (,?,!, etc.) should be ignored when grading.

## Typo detection

The student's answer can be at most edit distance 1 off from the correct 
answer for each word as long as the student's word is not a valid word in English. 
Swaps ("ae"/"ea") should count as edit distance 1.

For example:

    # edit distance 1 for each word
    >>> grade("The man eats the cheese.", "Thhe maan eatss thhe chheese")
    (True, "typo", [...])

    # "thhhe" is edit distance 2 from "the"
    >>> grade("The man eats the cheese.", "Thhe maan eatss thhhe chheese")
    (False, "wrong_word", [...])

    # "housed" is edit distance 1 but is a valid English word
    >>> grade("house", "housed")
    (False, "wrong_word", [...])

## Missing word detection

If exactly one word is missing in the student's answer, grade() needs to highlight it.
    
    # "is" is missing
    >>> grade("This is my house.", "This my house!")
    (False, "missing", [((5,7), (5,5))])

    # 2 words missing
    >>> grade("This is my house.", "This house!")
    (False, None, [])

## Wrong word detection

If exactly one word is wrong in the student's answer that word should be highlighted.
    
    >>> grade("This is my house.", "This is your house!")
    (False, "wrong_word", [((8,10), (8,12))])

    # 2 words wrong
    >>> grade("That is my house.", "This is your house!")
    (False, None, [])

## Unicode Support

Make sure your function understands unicode characters.

    >>> grade(u"über is not an English word", u"über is an English word")
    (False, "missing", [((8,11), (8,8))])

# Hand-In

The source code (and installation instructions if necessary).

# Evaluation

Your code is going to be evaluated by the following criteria:

1. Correctness: 
    Does grade() work correctly for common inputs?
2. Completeness: 
    Does grade() work for corner cases? 
3. Cleanliness: 
    Is the code well organized and is it easily readable?
4. Performance: 
    Is the code fast?
